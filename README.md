- [x] WTF is this??? 

  > Study the parallel performance and the scalability of your implementation, considering both fixed problem size and scaled problem size scalability.

    Task:

    >To this end, divide the processes into a p*1 mesh as equally as possible, and assign a strip of the computational domain to each of them as illustrated in Figure 1.

    What is the difference between above and **Trivial Implementation** bellow?

    >Given p processes, we slice the sum into p pieces, attach one interval to each of them to compute a partial sum, and then collect the local sums into one process.
